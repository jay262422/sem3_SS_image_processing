# Image Processing using Scilab Tool

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of image processing using **Scilab**, an open-source software for numerical computation. The graphical user interface (GUI) built for this project provides various image processing functionalities, allowing users to apply different transformations and filters to an image.

## Features

The GUI includes the following image processing options:
- **Read and Display Image**: Load an image and display it.
- **RGB to Grayscale Conversion**: Convert the image from RGB to grayscale.
- **RGB to HSV Conversion**: Convert the image to HSV color space.
- **Image Negative**: Generate the negative of the image.
- **Thresholding**: Apply binary thresholding.
- **Dilate**: Perform image dilation using a structural element.
- **Erode**: Perform image erosion.
- **Low Pass Filter**: Apply smoothing using a low pass filter.
- **High Pass Filter**: Enhance edges using a high pass filter.
- **Salt and Pepper Noise**: Add noise to the image.
- **Edge Detection**: Detect edges using the Canny edge detection method.

## How to Use

1. Open the Scilab environment and load the GUI script.
2. Use the buttons in the GUI to perform the desired image processing tasks.
3. Each transformation is applied sequentially, and results are displayed in real-time.
